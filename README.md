# MedicRec

The idea of this blockchain project is to use dynamic NFT to store patient's medical record, the smart contracts are written using Aiken language. There are two smart contracts, the mint contract is to mint two NFTs, one is minted to patient's wallet, and the other called reference NFT which is then stored in referene_store smart contract. To update the metadata of the NFT(in the patient's wallet), we basically update the reference NFT.
